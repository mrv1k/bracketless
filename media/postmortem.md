## Motivation

### Deadlines

1. Initial deadline was to finish the extension in 3 days. It (obviously) didn't work, even the first implementation took 6 days to complete. 3 more self-set deadlines followed and failed. The idea behind deadlines was to get shit done.

1. Deadlines are good, they helped me to stay motivated.

1. As tasks grew more complex I came to a realization that constant setting and failing deadlines started doing more harm than good. I decided to take my time to finish the extension and release it when its ready. No deadline.

1. I got better at estimating how long a feature may take as the project progressed, but because it's a self owned project I had the luxury of abandoning deadlines. At that point I was enjoying the coding process itself and didn't need deadlines to keep myself motivated.

The extension was released on November 9, 2017. 58 days after I created the repo.

### Habits

1. When I just started writing the extension, I knew I needed to build a habit of coding every day. At first, I failed to stay consistent but the failure helped me to realize the importance of making it a habit.

1. Making it a habit is what allowed me to drop project deadlines altogether.

1. Nothing bad unless you abuse it somehow.

1. Even after the project is over this habit helps me to move forward.

## Self education

### Tutorials

1. Watching/following tutorials helped to be a bit more ready for the first project. At least they made me confident, however, it was a short ride and soon I was searching everything but the basics.

1. I knew what and where to search.

1. Tutorials only helped me **familiarize** myself with the subject, they did NOT help me learn it.

1. In the past 4 years of self education not a single tutorial was able to teach me what I learned by doing a project.

### Books

+ Knowledge gained by reading the book series "You Don't Know JavaScript" by getify helped me the most with this project. (I've read first 4)

## Planning

### Without a plan

1. I started this project only having an idea, no planning involved. It's a really bad idea unless it your first project (which was the case) in which case you can go ahead because you don't know what you're doing anyway :D

1. Okay, I'm lying, the idea itself was a very generalized plan. It was enough to get me to the first version.

1. Having general idea I didn't see the whole picture which cost me dearly down the line. Particularly, last couple weeks when I was finishing the extension.

1. Planning is hard. It impossible without experience, you simply cannot plan what you don't know.

### With a plan

1. It's a must for any project that takes longer than a day.

1. My plans helped me to stay on track and eliminate the question of what to do next.

1. Overplanning is a thing, I've experienced it firsthand. My first plan was a disaster. I created a huge plan where every point was expected to work but some of them didn't, that led to a domino effect and the whole plan just fell apart. It's important to have a plan for major & minor features without going too deep.

1. What worked for me was the balance between main plan for major & minor features and small daily plans. It's important to keep daily plans small so that they are achievable within a day.

## First project specific

### The first version

1. The first is the scariest. I questioned my abilities a lot. _Would I be able to make it through? What if I fail?_ The questions were full of self doubt.

1. It’s important to get main functionality ready as soon as possible so you can test the idea. Bracketless idea has met the expectations. It was doing what I expected even though it was very buggy.

1. While developing the first version of the first project I made a lot of logic mistakes and that cost me later in development as I had to refactor everything.

1. It is scary to start the first project, but just close your eyes and do it. Nothing bad can happen. What is the worst case scenario that could happen? Project failure? The amount of new knowledge that you gain will easily patch that wound. Always consider what will happen if you don't start it - nothing. _If you change nothing, nothing will change._

## Other

### Working alone

1. I am a pretty people independent person and I expected it to reflect in development. Not exactly the case.

1. **Single responsibility**, I avoided organizational overhead and had easy time making changing on the fly.

1. A few actually:

    + **Full responsibility**. My project, I own it. I don’t like CSS, well nobody would do that for me, so I just suffered through. Quality is the currency.
    + **Avoidance**. Happened to me a couple times. I knew what to do, I knew it would be difficult and still I delayed the completion until I had to do it. The end result was the same, I found myself doing that task later anyway.
    + **Hard tasks**. There was a particularly hard problem that took me 4 back to back iterations and 10 hours to solve, just to arrive at the beginning but with a new perspective. Solution worked as expected, but I had to talk someone. I had to bitch about the difficulty.

1. Working alone has its benefits but limitations are plenty. There’s a constant pressure that you’re the only one who can do it. It is hard but manageable. Be ready to do everything.

### All or nothing mindset

1. Close to the end of development, I got this mindset that based on how much time I've spent developing this extension I might as well take extra time and not rush it.

1. It's a good thing to take extra time and polish the project.

1. It's a dangerous mindset as it eliminates time from the development equation. The most precious thing that I have.

1. I think this mindset tolerable as long as you strictly **strictly** limit this time. I didn't limit the time which lead me to start procrastinating. Being an experienced procrastinator I realized it relatively quickly and immediately ended this mindset and published the extension. (That's why I have published version 0.7.2 instead of planned 1.0)
